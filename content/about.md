I'm Dhanush Kumar Shankar from Boston Massachusetts. I have completed my Master's degree in Information Systems from Northeastern University. I'm trying to catch up with the current advancements in AI, and this has been quite interesting but pretty challenging. My areas of interest and my speciality lies in Natural Language Processing (NLP).<br>

I have worked as a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at Standard Chareted Bank in India for nearly 2.5 years. I was part of founding member of AI/ML Delivery Team where I have worked on multiple projects from scoping till Model deployment and monitoring.

I have also worked as a Teaching assistant for the MLOPs course (IE7374) under Professor Ramin Mohammadi. If you'd like to learn more about the work done by the professor and our TA team, you can find it on this [website](https://www.mlwithramin.com/mlops/)
