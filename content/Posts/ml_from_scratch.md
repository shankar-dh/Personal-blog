To further improve upon my knowledge on ML algorithms, I'm trying to implement popular algorithms from scratch only using NumPy. Even though the world is moving towards LLMs, Rags and Langchain I belive that having a strong foundation would really help in understanding these advanced algorithms better.<br>

You can find my progress in this [repository](https://github.com/shankar-dh/ML-Algos-Scratch) and I'd welcome any feedback!
